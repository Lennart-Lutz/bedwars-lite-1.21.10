# Bedwars Lite (Fabric Mod)

**Bedwars Lite** is a lightweight Minecraft mod that brings the classic *Bedwars* gameplay into your 1.21.10 Fabric server — simple, fast, and fully team-based.  
Each bed acts as a team base, and players can join, fight, and defend their beds to survive!

## Gameplay Overview

- **Join a team:**  
  Right-click any bed to join its team.  
  The bed’s **color** determines your **team color**.

- **Team mechanics:**
    - No **friendly fire** between players of the same team.
    - Players **cannot break** their own bed.
    - However, a **player’s own explosions** can still destroy their team’s bed!

- **Bed destruction:**
    - Enemy players can destroy your team’s bed either by **mining** or **explosions**.
    - Once a bed is destroyed, all players receive a notification in chat.

- **Respawning:**
    - If your team’s bed is destroyed, you will **no longer respawn** near it after death.
    - Instead, you respawn at the **world spawn** as a **spectator**.
    - If a player cannot spawn near their bed (e.g., blocked area), they are eliminated.

- **Team elimination:**
    - When all players of a team are eliminated, that team loses.
    - The game continues until only one team remains standing.

## Notes

- Once you join a team, you **cannot switch teams** until your team is eliminated.
